# Binary-Tree-Generator
### This program creates a GUI that takes a input from the user and creates a binary tree, then creates multiple functions in the GUI that use the binary tree.
A GUI is displayed that allows the user to enter the nodes of a binary tree (letter or number followed by a parenthesis holding the children, no spaces) and check the height, number of nodes, if the tree is full, in order, or proper.
